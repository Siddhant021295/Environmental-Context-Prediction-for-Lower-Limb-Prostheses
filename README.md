# Environmental-Context-Prediction-for-Lower-Limb-Prostheses

## Project Overview

Types of terrain pose challenge for intelligent prosthetic limbs. Our task is to use accelerometer and gyroscope readings, from sensors attached to the legs of subjects, to predict the type of surface the subject is walking on. There are four types of terrain/activity that are considered: (0) indicates standing or walking on solid ground, (1) indicates going down the stairs,(2) indicates going up the stairs, and (3) indicates walking on grass.
